When reporting, please include the following information:

* Type of issue
* Which source file or Third-party component is affected

## Adding Third-Party Libraries to OpenRadioss

Third-party libraries may introduce security issues when provided as source code and/or binaries.

Contact the OpenRadioss community manager at [webmaster@openradioss.org](mailto:webmaster@openradioss.org) if you need to add a Third-party library to your development project.

When doing so, please indicate:

* The source of the Third-party (website or repository)
* The license attached to this Third-party

The OpenRadioss community will investigate the feasibility of adding this Third-party to OpenRadioss. If approved, the new Third-party will be added to the `extlib` directory.
