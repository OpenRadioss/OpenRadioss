# What is OpenRadioss?
OpenRadioss® is the Open-source version of Radioss®

Radioss is a leading analysis solution to evaluate and optimize product performance for highly nonlinear problems under dynamic loadings. Used worldwide across all industry sectors, it improves the crashworthiness, safety, and manufacturability of complex designs.

For more than 30 years, Radioss has been an industry leader and standard for automotive crash and safety, shock and impact analysis, drop test, terminal ballistic, blast and explosion effects and high-velocity impacts. Recognized across R&D centers as well as companies in automotive, aerospace, electronics, and defense, Radioss enables understanding and efficient, robust predictions of combined multiphysics behaviors in complex environments, such as crashworthiness, airplane ditching, terminal ballistics, or blast effects on vehicles. Exploiting Radioss' advanced multi-processor versions enables the best scalability in the industry for large, highly nonlinear structural simulations.

As a key part of Altair’s simulation solutions, Radioss is a powerful multiphysics design tool with optimization-ready integrations with other Altair tools and third-party solutions.
